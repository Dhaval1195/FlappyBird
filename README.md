# FlappyBird

This is a simple implementation of the popular game Flappy Bird using Python. The game is built using the Pygame library and provides a fun and challenging experience for players.

Instructions
Ensure that you have Python and Pygame installed on your system.
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Run the following command to start the game:

`python main.py`

The game window will open, and you can use the spacebar to control the bird's flight.
Your goal is to navigate the bird through the gaps between the pipes without colliding with them or the ground. Every successful gap passage earns you a point.
The game will end if the bird collides with a pipe or the ground.
After the game ends, you can press the spacebar to restart and play again.
